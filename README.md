This is the place holder for the **Keypatch** tool that we will release at our Blackhat USA talk next week.
Stay tuned!

After [Capstone](http://www.capstone-engine.org) ([Blackhat USA 2014](https://www.blackhat.com/us-14/briefings.html#capstone-next-generation-disassembly-framework)) and [Unicorn](http://www.unicorn-engine.org) ([Blackhat USA 2015](https://www.blackhat.com/us-15/briefings.html#unicorn-next-generation-cpu-emulator-framework)), [Keystone](http://keystone-engine.org) is our lastest effort to build the foundation for future binary analysis tools. Do not miss the chance to see the last missing piece of RE frameworks launched at [Blackhat USA 2016](https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/briefings.html#keystone-engine-next-generation-assembler-framework) next week!

As a part of our talk on Keystone, we will release a brand new Reversing tool named **Keypatch**! We strongly believe that *Keypatch* can become an indispensable part of your RE toolkit, which you have been longing for, since forever.

Come to see our talk about **Keystone** & see the demo on this little fun tool.

- Place: **South Seas IJ**, Convention Center, Mandalay Bay, Las Vegas, USA
- Time: **09:25 August 4th**, 2016

We will bring to Blackhat [some swags (like stickers, Tshirts)](http://www.keystone-engine.org/donate.html) of the Reverse Engineering Trilogy Capstone/Unicorn/Keystone. See me after our talk if you want them :-)
